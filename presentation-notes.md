# Near infrared spectroscopy

780 nm - 2500 nm

Data 1100 - 2500

- 3 * num atoms - 6 normal modes of vibrations for non-linear molecules
- Vibrations have different frequencies

$$A = -\log_{10}(I / I_0)$$
$$A = kdc$$
$$c = A / (kd)$$

- $A$: Absorbance
- $c$: Concentration of compound
- $I_0$ Intensity of light shined on material
- $I$ is the measured reflected light

## Data and task

Wood chips put into a cup and measured in the FOSS machine

Challenge: How to give wood a second life?

Grade A-D of waste wood
- A Clean wood
- B Industrial feedstock
- C Fuel grade
- D Hazardous waste, e.g. impregnated wood

Collected samples from seven places: 5 recycling centers, and two other places

Dataset: 117 x 3 reps x 32 scans x 700 variables

Make a classification model for
- Treated wood (1)
- Virgin wood (2)
- Disposal wood (3)

Evaluation
- Misclassification rate
- Description of challenges and / or discoveries during the analysis
- Identification of important wavelengths in the classification task

Hand in
- An ascii file with classifications according to the three classes (1-3)
- A pdf/powerpoint answering point 2 and 3 above
